## Privacy Statement
I've learned from my (luckily rather minor) mistakes in previous projects and decided not to save the private chat files in the same directory as the open source code files. Instead, a secure folder can be set up in the `.env`, which makes it so that all chats are saved securely in a completely different folder.
